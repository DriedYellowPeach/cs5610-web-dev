              We are living in an unprecedented era where artificial
              intelligence is becoming an integral part of creative and
              technical workflows. This very page serves as a testament to that
              collaboration - designed and generated with the assistance of
              Claude, an AI assistant.

              AI tools are not replacing developers; they're amplifying our
              capabilities. Like how a calculator doesn't replace a
              mathematician but enables them to tackle more complex problems, AI
              assistants enable developers to focus on higher-level design
              decisions while handling implementation details.

              <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
              <p>
                The human brain has approximately 86 billion neurons. Modern AI
                neural networks can have billions of parameters, but they're
                still far simpler than our biological neural networks.

              <h3>Code Generation</h3>
              <p>
                AI can now write code in over 40 programming languages. Studies
                show AI-assisted developers can complete tasks up to 55% faster
                than those working alone.

              <h3>Training Data</h3>
              <p>
                Large language models are trained on datasets containing
                hundreds of billions of tokens. That's more text than a single
                human could read in a thousand lifetimes!

              <h3>Creative AI</h3>
              <p>
                AI can now generate images, music, and even entire videos. The
                boundary between human and AI-generated content is becoming
                increasingly blurred.
