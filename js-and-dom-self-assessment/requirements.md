# Requirements

Implement a page that displays and loads all the first 50 listings from the JSON file using AJAX (JavaScript fetch and await) as done in class.

The page should show the listing name, description, amenities, host (name and photo), price, thumbnail, and some creative addition that separates your code from others. Please submit your github repo, and include a meaningful README that links to the deployment location (e.g. github-pages)

The data is in `./airbnb_sf_listings_500.json`
